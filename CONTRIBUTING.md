# How to contribute #

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.  There are
a just a few small guidelines you need to follow.


## Contributor License Agreement ##

Contributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor
License Agreement.  This is not a copyright **assignment**, it simply gives
Google permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
project.

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual
    CLA][].

  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][].

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted
one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

[corporate CLA]: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate

Once your CLA is submitted (or if you already submitted one for
another Google project), make a commit adding yourself to the
[AUTHORS][] and [CONTRIBUTORS][] files. This commit can be part
of your first [Differential][] code review.
