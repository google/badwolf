BadWolf is a temporal graph store loosely modeled after the concepts introduced
by the
[Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework).
It presents a flexible storage abstraction, efficient query language, and
data-interchange model for representing a directed graph that accommodates the
storage and linking of arbitrary objects without the need for a rigid schema.

BadWolf began as a [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore),
but triples have been expanded to quads to allow simpler and flexible temporal
reasoning. Because BadWolf is designed for generalized relationship storage,
most of the web-related idiosyncrasies of RDF are not used and have been toned
down or directly removed and focuses on its time reasoning aspects.

In case you are curious about the name, BadWolf is named after the
[BadWolf entity](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Bad_Wolf_(entity) ) as it appeared
in Dr. Who series episode _"The Parting Of Ways"_ after Rose Tyler looked into
the Time Vortex itself. The BadWolf entity scattered events in time as self
encode messages, creating a looped ontological paradox. Hence, naming a temporal
graph store after the entity seemed appropriate.
