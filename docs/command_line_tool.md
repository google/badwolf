# Command line tool: bw

`bw` is the main command line tool used to access various functionality.
The `bw` command line tool is built via the `tools/vcli/bw` package. You
can build the tool by just typing

```
$ go test ./... && go build ./tools/vcli/bw
```

Is the test pass successfully you will get the `bw` tool ready to go.

## Usage

Once built, you will be able to access the commands available by typing:

```
$ bw help
```

This command will list of available options already. Also, you can always type

```
$ bw help COMMAND
```

To list the help related to the provided command. There are a set of flags
available for the `bw` tool. To list them just type:

```
$ bw -h
```

Keep in mind that all flags should be listed before you enter the command
you want to run.

## Command: Version

The version command prints the version of BadWolf being used. Below you can
find and example of the command output.

```
$ bw version
badwolf vCli (0.4.1-dev)
```

## Command: Run

The `run` command allows you to run all the BQL statements contained in a
given file. All lines in the file starting with # will be treated as comments
and will be discarded. An example of a file containing a set of executable
statements can be found at
[examples/bql/example_0.bql](../examples/bql/example_0.bql).
Below you can find the output of using the `run` command against the previously
mentioned.

```
$ bw run examples/bql/example_0.bql
Processing file examples/bql/example_0.bql

Processing statement (1/5):
CREATE GRAPH ?family;

Result:

Processing statement (2/5):
INSERT DATA INTO ?family { /u<joe> "parent_of"@[] /u<mary> . /u<joe> "parent_of"@[] /u<peter> . /u<peter> "parent_of"@[] /u<john> . /u<peter> "parent_of"@[] /u<eve> };

Result:
OK

Processing statement (3/5):
SELECT ?name FROM ?family WHERE { /u<joe> "parent_of"@[] ?offspring ID ?name };

Result:

peter

OK

Processing statement (4/5):
SELECT ?grandchildren_name FROM ?family WHERE { /u<joe> "parent_of"@[] ?offspring . ?offspring "parent_of"@[] ?grandchildren ID ?grandchildren_name };

Result:
?grandchildren_name
john
eve

OK

Processing statement (5/5):
DROP GRAPH ?family;

Result:
OK
```

## Command: Assert

The `assert` command allows you to run all the stories contained in a given
folder. Stories are serialized as JSON files. Each story contains:

1. One or more sources. A source is a graph defined by the triples it contain.
2. One or more assertions. An assertion is a BQL query and the expected outcome.

An example of a simple story with only one assertion could be:

```
  "Name": "Family tree",
  "Sources": [
    {
      "ID": "?family",
      "Facts": [
        "/u<joe> \"parent_of\"@[] /u<mary>",
        "/u<joe> \"parent_of\"@[] /u<peter>",
        "/u<peter> \"parent_of\"@[] /u<john>",
        "/u<peter> \"parent_of\"@[] /u<eve>"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Assertions": [
    {
      "Requires": "finding all Joe's offspring name",
      "Statement": "
      SELECT ?name
      FROM ?family
      WHERE {
        /u<joe> \"parent_of\"@[] ?offspring ID ?name
      }
      ORDER BY ?name;",
      "WillFail": false,
      "MustReturn": [
        {
          "?name": "mary"
        },
        {
          "?name": "peter"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

The `assert` command will collect all story files and run every one of them
collecting the outcome and evaluating of each the assertion. Stories are heavily
used to validate BQL semantic behavior. All compliance stories can be found at
[examples/compliance](../examples/compiance). Compliance stories guarantee that
all backend storage drivers that implement `storage.Store` and `storage.Graph`
provide the exact same behavior. If a driver does not pass the compliance tests
in the aforementioned folder, it will be an indication of a serious bug and
should not be used since may lead to wrong results.

Below you can find the output of using the `assert` command against the
compliance folder that guarantees BQL returns the expected results.

## Command: BQL

The `bql` command starts a REPL that allows running BQL commands. The REPL can
provide basic help on usage as shown below. Currently the REPL has limited
support for terminal input. BQL statements need to be in a single line and there
is currently not support for cursor keys neither history of past BQL statements.

```
$ bw bql

```

## Command: Benchmark

The `benchmark` commands will run a battery of tests to collect timing measures
against the chosen backend. The benchmarks focus on performance of:

1. Adding triples to a graph.
2. Removing triples from a graph.
3. BQL statements to bound backend performance.

All this benchmarks run against synthetic data using two graph generators:

1. _Tree graph generator_: Given an arbitrary branching factor it generates
   the requested number of triples by walking an imaginary tree in depth first
   search. The height of the tree is used to generate a set of triples is
   computed as log(number of triples)/log(branching factor).

2. _Random graph generator_: Given a number of nodes in a graph, this generator
   creates triples by picking two arbitrary nodes and creating a triple that
   relates them together. The sampling of the nodes pair is done without
   replacement.

These two generators create graph with very different structural properties.

All benchmarks consist on generating random triple sets using both generators
and using them as the graph to which to run the operations. Each benchmark is
run 10 times and the the average and standard deviation of the time spend to
run the operation is computed. Also, the benchmark runner computes an
approximation of how many triples per second were processed.

Each benchmark battery is run twice, sequentially and concurrently. The goal is
to also measure the impact of concurrent operations on the driver. Currently
the command does not allow you to choose any of the parameters used.

Below there is an example of how to run the benchmarks against the default
in memory driver.

```
$ bw --driver=VOLATILE benchmark
