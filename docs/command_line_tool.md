# Command line tool: bw

`bw` is the main command line tool used to access various functionality.
The `bw` command line tool is built via the `tools/vcli/bw` package. You
can build the tool by just typing

```
$ go test github.com/google/badwolf/... && go build github.com/google/badwolf/tools/vcli/bw
```

If the test pass successfully, the `bw` tool will be placed in the current
directory.

## Usage

Once built, you will be able to access the commands available by typing:

```
$ bw help
```

This command will list available options. Also, you can always type

```
$ bw help COMMAND
```

To list the help related to the provided command. There are a set of flags
available for the `bw` tool. To list them just type:

```
$ bw -h
```

> Keep in mind that all flags should be listed before you enter the command
> you want to run. If you attempt to set the flags after the command they
> will be be treated as arguments of it and, hence, they will not be 
> properly set and likely get unexpected results.

## Command: Version

The version command prints the version of BadWolf being used. Below you can
find and example of the command output.

```
$ bw version
badwolf vCli (0.4.1-dev)
```

## Command: Run

The `run` command allows you to run all the BQL statements contained in a
given file. All lines in the file starting with # will be treated as comments
and will be discarded. An example of a file containing a set of executable
statements can be found at
[examples/bql/example_0.bql](../examples/bql/example_0.bql).
Below you can find the output of using the `run` command against the previously
mentioned.

```
$ bw run examples/bql/example_0.bql

Result:
?grandchildren_name
john
eve

OK

Processing statement (5/5):
DROP GRAPH ?family;

Result:
OK
```

## Command: Assert

The `assert` command allows you to run all the stories contained in a given
folder. Stories are serialized as JSON files. Each story contains:

1. One or more sources. A source is a graph defined by the triples it contain.
2. One or more assertions. An assertion is a BQL query and the expected outcome.

An example of a simple story with only one assertion could be:

```
  "Name": "Family tree",
  "Sources": [
    {
      "ID": "?family",
      "Facts": [
        "/u<joe> \"parent_of\"@[] /u<mary>",
        "/u<joe> \"parent_of\"@[] /u<peter>",
        "/u<peter> \"parent_of\"@[] /u<john>",
        "/u<peter> \"parent_of\"@[] /u<eve>"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Assertions": [
    {
      "Requires": "finding all Joe's offspring name",
      "Statement": "
      SELECT ?name
      FROM ?family
      WHERE {
        /u<joe> \"parent_of\"@[] ?offspring ID ?name
      }
      ORDER BY ?name;",
      "WillFail": false,
      "MustReturn": [
        {
          "?name": "mary"
        },
        {
          "?name": "peter"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

The `assert` command will collect all story files and run every one of them
collecting the outcome and evaluating of each the assertion. Stories are heavily
used to validate BQL semantic behavior. All compliance stories can be found at
[examples/compliance](../examples/compiance). Compliance stories guarantee that
all backend storage drivers that implement `storage.Store` and `storage.Graph`
provide the exact same behavior. If a driver does not pass the compliance tests
in the aforementioned folder, it will be an indication of a serious bug and
should not be used since may lead to wrong results.

Below you can find the output of using the `assert` command against the
compliance folder that guarantees BQL returns the expected results.

## Command: BQL

The `bql` command starts a REPL that allows running BQL commands. The REPL can
provide basic help on usage as shown below. Currently, the REPL has limited
support for terminal input. BQL statements need to be in a single line and there
is currently no support for cursor keys or history of past BQL statements.

```

bql> 
```

## Command: Benchmark

The `benchmark` commands will run a battery of tests to collect timing measures
against the chosen backend. The benchmarks focus on performance of:

1. Adding triples to a graph.
2. Removing triples from a graph.
3. BQL statements to bound backend performance.

All these benchmarks run against synthetic data using two graph generators:

1. _Tree graph generator_: Given an arbitrary branching factor it generates
   the requested number of triples by walking an imaginary tree in depth first
   search. The height of the tree is used to generate a set of triples is
   computed as log(number of triples)/log(branching factor).

2. _Random graph generator_: Given a number of nodes in a graph, this generator
   creates triples by picking two arbitrary nodes and creating a triple that
   relates them together. The sampling of the nodes pair is done without
   replacement.

These two generators create graphs with very different structural properties.

All benchmarks consist of generating random triple sets using both generators
and using them as the graphs on which to run the operations. Each benchmark is
run 10 times and the average and standard deviation of the time spent to
run the operation is computed. Also, the benchmark runner computes an
approximation of how many triples per second were processed.

Each benchmark battery is run twice, sequentially and concurrently. The goal is
to also measure the impact of concurrent operations on the driver. Currently,
the command does not allow you to choose any of the parameters used.

There is an example below of how to run the benchmarks against the default
in-memory driver.

```
$ bw --driver=VOLATILE benchmark
DISCLAIMER: Running this benchmarks is expensive. Consider using a machine with at least 3G of RAM.

```

## Command: Load

Loads all the triples stored in a file into the provided graphs.
Graph names need to be separated by commands with no whitespaces. Each triple
needs to placed in a single line. Each triple needs to be formated so it can be
parsed as indicated in the [documetation](./temporal_graph_modeling.md). 
Please, also feel free to check this [example text file](./presentations/2016/06/21/data/triples.txt)
and some examples of how to use it in this 
[presentation](http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/google/badwolf/docs/presentations/2016/06/21/ottawa-graph-meetup.slide#1)
All data in the file will be treated as triples. 
A line starting with # willbe treated as a commented line. If the load fails you may 
end up with partially loaded data.

```
$ bw load ./triples.txt ?graph
```

It also suports importing into multiple graphs at once.

```
$ bw load ./triples.txt ?graph1,?graph2,?graph3
```


## Command: Export

Export all the triples in the provided graphs into the provided text file. 

```
$ bw export ?graph ./triples.txt
```
As the export command, it suports exporting multiple graphs at once.

```
$ badwolf export ?graph1,?graph2,?grpah3 ./triples.txt
```

## Command: Server

The ```server``` command starts a simple HTTP endpoint for BQL commands on
the provided port. 

```
$ bw server 1234
```

This will start an enpoint on port ```1234```. You can just access the
endpoint by hitting [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234). 
This will render a simple for you to enter muliple BQL queries.

The endpoint for queries can be accessed at 
[http://localhost:1234/bql](http://localhost:1234/bql) by posting a
form with ```bqlQuery``` parameter. The enpoint returns, in JSON format,
and array of results. Each element of the array contains:

* _query_: The original passed query.
* _msg_: A human readable message. It will contain error information if the
         query failed to execute correctly.
* _table_: If the query was run successfully and a query result was produced, 
           _table_ will contain an array with the output bidings under
		   _bindings_. The table data will be provided as an array of rows
		   under the _rows_ field. Each row entry represents an object where
		   the fields are the binding name and the valu an object containing
		   the cell value. The cell value is an object that may contain 
		   one of the following fields depending on the value type:
		   _string_, _node_, _pred_, _lit_, or _anchor_. All the values
		   are represented using the string format for each time. Time 
		   anchors are formated following 
		   (RFC3339Nano)[https://godoc.org/time#pkg-constants].

For instance you can pass the following queries to the endpoint

```
create graph ?test;

insert data into ?test {
   /foo<id> "knows"@[] /bar<id>.
   /foo<id> "follows"@[] /bar<id>
};

select ?s,?p,?o,?k,?l,?m
from ?test
where {
  ?s ?p ?o.
  ?k ?l ?m
};
```

The endpoint will execute each of the statements in order and return and array
of JSON formated objects, one for each query. For the above example you should
get the following JSON on a newly started server:

```
[{
	"query": "create graph ?test;",
	"msg": "[OK]",
	"table": {
		"bindings": [],
		"rows": []
	}
}, {
	"query": "insert data into ?test {     /foo<id> \"knows\"@[] /bar<id>.     /foo<id> \"follows\"@[] /bar<id>  };",
	"msg": "[OK]",
	"table": {
		"bindings": [],
		"rows": []
	}
}, {
	"query": "select ?s,?p,?o,?k,?l,?m  from ?test  where {    ?s ?p ?o.    ?k ?l ?m  };",
	"msg": "[OK]",
	"table": {
		"bindings": ["?s", "?p", "?o", "?k", "?l", "?m"],
		"rows": [{

		}]
	}
}]
```
